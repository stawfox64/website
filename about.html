    <h1>About Marcelino</h1>
    <p>Born in San Diego, after having a short stint in the Bay Area spanning San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland, I moved back home at the start of the pandemic and have been enjoying the sun ever since.</p>

 <p>Ultimately I would love to push myself and my limits to the abosolute maximum, I find it's the perfect way for myself to learn!</p>

 <p>Previously a Vocal Performance major with a focus in Opera, with the pandemic hitting everyone hard, I decided to start from square one and start a very rewarding and fun career in Web Design and Development.I love problem solving and figuring out the best ways to convey the many creative ideas that people have</p>

 <p>Most recently, I was given the oppertunity to be put on the SouthWestern College Vice President's list for Academic Distinction</p>
