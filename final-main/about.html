            <p>In 2008, our founders Harry and Amelie, who were born and raised in the San Francisco bay area, met while attending the University of California San Francisco through their mutual love of adventure and the ocean they would frequent many beaches along the coastline of the Bay Area.After receiving their degress from the University they decided that the world should be able to view the great Pacific Ocean and welcome into their lives the tranquility and natural mental healing that it brings. <br/><br/>

            In 2012 Amelie and Harry decided to take the next step in their adventerous lives and open Pacific Trails Resort, leaving their tech 9-5 jobs to bring enrichment to the lives of others and since then Pacific Trails Resort has been featured in numerous magazines all around the United States as well as received recognition in international waters for the high class,quality, and service that they and their staff bring to every guest.
